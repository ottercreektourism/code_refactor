# code_refactor

Task:

Given starter code for a simple company website, the task was to refactor the code to make it more accessable to users with screen readers, and to all users in general. The end product should look identical to what was initially given.


What was done:

- Adjusted all of the <div> tags to be something more meaningful than <div>. Replaced many of them with header, main, section, nav, and aside.
- Added alt text to images
- Changed the title of the website to something more descriptive
- Condensed and consolidated the classes so that there were fewer lines of code and it was all straight-forward.
- Added comments for easy navigation of code
- Put h1-h4 in logical order
